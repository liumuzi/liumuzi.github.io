The course project of CSCI3170, a group project that designs and implements a SQL database system with an interactive interface using Java. 


### The Course
I took the course CSCI3170 in 2019 spring term. The course is mainly about topics related to SQL database.

It introduces the design principles and evaluation methods of database, as well as the deep down mechanisms (e.g. Disks, Buffer Management, Transactions) and data structures (e.g. B+ Tree, Hash-based Indexes). It was not a hard course, but it did help to broaden my understanding of databases and storages.

### Course Project Topic
The project requires students to design and implement a recruitment system for managing data relevant to job recruitment, involving employee, employer, position, and employment history. The system provides an interactive interface to system administrator, employee, and employer. 

This project is divided into 2 phases: <br>
* In phase 1, you are required to design a database for the system (including an ER-diagram and a relational schema). <br>
* In phase 2, you are required to implement the system as a Java command-line program.  Our tutors will give tutorials on how to connect to a MySQL database system with JDBC API and deploy your work on the required platform.
