title: Reinforcement Learning for Convention Emergence in Lexicon Coordination Game
categories: [research, interest, multi-agent system, reinforcement learning, C/C++]
---
I worked as a research assistant to professor [Leung Ho Fung](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~lhf/) since summer 2019. I conducted a research independently with professor Leung's responsible supervise and careful guidance, where I learned a lot about how to research for a interested topic, how to start a research, and how to write a paper. 

### Works
* Proposed an effective and efficient reinforcement learning approach for convention emergence in lexicon coordination game. 
* Analyzed the simulation results and found relations between local conventions in the network and the
hindering of the emergence of a global convention.
* Independently wrote a paper for the whole work, which is on submission.
