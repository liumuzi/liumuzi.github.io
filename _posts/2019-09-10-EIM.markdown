[EIM](http://www.eim.hk/) is a programme lead by the Department of Sports Science & Physical Education in CUHK, with coorperation of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. It advocates adding exercise into chronic patients' ordinary treatment. 

The computer science and engineering department is mainly responsible to the development of a web app and a mobile app, which are used to upload and present the exercise data catched by patients' smart bracelets. 

I worked as a back-end developer of the web app with the team led by professor [James Cheng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jcheng/index.html) in this summer. During the development, I learnt a lot of tools adn technologies of web development, and I also got a lot of chances to practice them.


### Works
* Self-learnt tools used in the project, such as docker, TypeORM, and Azure storage service 

* Developed a part of the back-end APIs using TypeORM and MSSQL database 

* Designed the incentive and achievement system to encourage chronic patients to exercise regularly
