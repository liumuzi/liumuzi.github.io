### Descriptions
Winnie, a pretty, but hysterical girl.

Hunger: 100
Sanity: 120
Health: 150

__Has a small stomach__<br>
-- 100 max hunger<br>
-- slower digestion (0.8 hunger rate)

__Fatal attraction__<br>
-- players near by can restore sanity<br>
-- attracts bees and butterflies

__Gets hysterical easily__<br>
-- causes more damage when sanity is low (1.5 damage, when sanity <= 60)<br>
-- walks faster (1.5 move speed)<br>
-- gets insane easier (dark creatures appear when sanity <= 30)

Because of the speed & damage buff and lower hunger rate, she is good at exploring map. Also, as she causes more damage when her sanity < 60 and dark animals attack her earlier than others, she produces nightmare fuel quickly.
